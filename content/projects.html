							<p>MyUniTrade began as a conversation with a friend from high-school over a beer and has since turned in to our first crack at a business venture! MyUniTrade is founded by two friends who are students at the University of Calgary that look after the ‘business’ side of things, another friend who is a classmate with me at UBCO and myself. My responsibilities for the site lay primarily on user interaction. I take care of the front-end development and assist in hooking up our backend Ruby on Rails framework. MyUniTrade is a student-to-student textbook exchange site which launched January 10th, 2015 at UofC. We meet remotely every week over skype and collaboratively build up our project. <br><br> <strong>Skills practiced/utilized with this project</strong>: HTML, CSS, Javascipt, Ruby on Rails, GIT, project management software, business strategy and marketing.</p>

								<p>MoodMaster is a project I am building with a friend of mine. Users enter/select from a list of moods which generates associated pages create by other users. These pages are designed to resonate with users feeling a particular mood and consist of links to auxiliary sources on the web (ie: music playlists, news articles, pictures). I am responsible for the back-end development for the site (RoR using a MySQL database). This project is still in development but more information/public repository can be provided upon request.<br><br> <strong>Skills practiced/utilized with this project</strong>: Ruby on Rails, GIT, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Utilizing various APIs and project management.</p>

									<p>The Kelowna Childcare Society is a NPO whose website a team and I redesigned as a school project.

										<p>A current team project of mine with the current name placeholder “Donation Platform” is a web app that gives users the ability to make quick micro-donations to charities. As a charity, you can register your organization. As a user, you can donate your own money to the charity of your choice, or allocate money “given” to you via a direct e-mail link. This project is still in the early stages of development and is aiming for completion around the end of April. I am responsible for all back-end development and back to front integration. <br><br> <strong>Skills practiced/utilized with this project</strong>: Php, Agile Development, project management, GIT and database design.</p>
