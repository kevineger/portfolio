During my fourth year at UBCO, I was asked by the professor of a third year computer science Human Computer Interaction (HCI) class to guest lecture.<br><br>I lectured for 80 minutes about color science, typography and frontend web development. My slides are publicly available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18_BUOz0momNpn4DTpreW80isezgASPXRZP1e-OdUT8Y/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. My lecture was focused on providing basic rules and guidelines that students of the class could apply to not only user-focused designed projects but their every day lives. I touched on import color and design choices spanning from their homework assignments to optimizing their IDE.<br><br>This was a great experience and I had a lot of fun preparing and delivering the content in a fun and manageable fashion.
