		<p>MyUniTrade was my first crack at a business venture. MyUniTrade was a student-to-student textbook exchange site which launched January 10th, 2015 at UofC. It was founded by two friends who are students at the University of Calgary persuing business degrees, a friend/peer at UBCO and myself. My responsibilities for the site lay primarily on user interaction. I took care of the front-end development and assisted in hooking up our backend (Ruby on Rails). MyUniTrade generated quite a large amount of traffic, peaking at over 1000 hits a day. What began as a promising business venture ended fizzling out due to lack of marketing and business logic in Calgary. I am still quite thankful to have had this experience as I learned a lot from it.</p>
