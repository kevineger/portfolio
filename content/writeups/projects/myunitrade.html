		<p>MyUniTrade began as a conversation with a friend from high-school over a beer and has since turned in to our first crack at a business venture! MyUniTrade is founded by two friends who are students at the University of Calgary that look after the ‘business’ side of things, another friend who is a classmate with me at UBCO and myself. My responsibilities for the site lay primarily on user interaction. I take care of the front-end development and assist in hooking up our backend Ruby on Rails framework. MyUniTrade is a student-to-student textbook exchange site which launched January 10th, 2015 at UofC. We meet remotely every week over skype and collaboratively build up our project. <br><br> <strong>Skills practiced/utilized with this project</strong>: HTML, CSS, Javascipt, Ruby on Rails, GIT, project management software, business strategy and marketing.</p>
