		<p>MoodMaster is a project I am building with a friend of mine. Users enter/select from a list of moods which generates associated pages create by other users. These pages are designed to resonate with users feeling a particular mood and consist of links to auxiliary sources on the web (ie: music playlists, news articles, pictures). I am responsible for the back-end development for the site (RoR using a MySQL database). This project is still in development but more information/public repository can be provided upon request.<br><br> <strong>Skills practiced/utilized with this project</strong>: Ruby on Rails, GIT, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Utilizing various APIs and project management.</p>
