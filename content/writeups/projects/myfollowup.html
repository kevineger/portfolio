		<p>Currently there is a limited understanding of the long term quality-of-life related side effects associated with certain radiation treatments and many other types of medical treatments and procedures in general. It can be a challenge or impractical for patients to continue to be seen by their specialist for years after their treatment. This is especially relevant in areas of the world like British Columbia as many individuals live in rural or northern communities and have to travel to meet with their specialist.<br><br>During my employment with the Early Detection Research Group at the BC Cancer Agency I developed an online system for monitoring patients after they have received their treatment. This project is serving to guide the development of a larger agency-wide online quality of life monitoring platform. The system consists of two web servers: an internal server which the doctors and administrators interact with within the agency and an external server which patients complete their surveys with. The internal server fully anonymizes patient data before populating the external serverâ€™s database for patients to complete their surveys. This project was particularly fulfilling to me knowing that it will benefit a large number of patients in the near future. Several user interviews were conducted with future adopters within the agency on both sides of the service as it was vital to meet their approval.
