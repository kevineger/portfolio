		<p>My honours thesis is geared towards developing a one-stop-shop for data analysis and resources for interpreting Reddit. The main deliverable for this project is developing a web app where the general public can easily access all the data and metrics they could hope for pertaining to Reddit. I have currently built up the User section and am now working on some deeper analysis with machine learning. Nearing completion is a standalone Python API built with Flask that allows me to easily access Google's Tensorflow Machine Learning library. Upon completing my implementation of image recognition with Tensorflow I plan to continue working on NLP techniques using Scikit-learn.<br><br>This section will continually update as I progress and I will link to my thesis report when available.</p>
