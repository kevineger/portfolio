		<p>Book Your Class is the company for my Capstone Engineering project this year. It is a startup idea by an innovator in Hong Kong. The service is for schools and institutions to better market their classes and provide the general public with a central hub for discovering them. The service operates through two mediums: a website and mobile app. My team 3 other computer science students and myself. I have taken on building the bulk of our web app and the API (for mobile consumers). We are developing with an agile-based project management mentality. I am the teamâ€™s project manager and oversee almost all of the development and meetings. We are building the web app with <i>Laravel</i> (a php framework) and the mobile app with <i>Phonegap</i> (a framework that allows you to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs and compile to Android, iOs, Windows and Blackberry).<br><br>Since this project is intended to be shipped as commercial software, I am unable to share either of our main repositories for public viewing but can provide code access upon request.</p>
