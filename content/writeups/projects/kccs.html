		<p>The Kelowna Childcare Society is a NPO whose website a team and I redesigned as a school project. Together, my team and I conducted multiple user interviews, orchestrated card-sorting activities and built the site from the ground up. The project was a collaborative team effort however I was responsible primarily for implementation of the site. <br><br> <strong>Skills practiced/utilized with this project</strong>: HTML, CSS, project management and database design.</p>
