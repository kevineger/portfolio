UBCO has approximately 8,300 students. The campus is located in the interior of British Columbia's scenic Okanagan valley that I am proud to call home. Studying at UBCO has allowed me to foster close relationships with like-minded peers and reputable professors. Being enrolled at a modestly sized school has taught me how to work effectively in a community driven environment.
