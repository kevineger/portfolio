Destination UBC is a full-day event where new students come to get their questions answered, connect with the UBC community, and start preparing for life as a UBC student. This event is only open to students who have been admitted to UBC.<br><br>My responsibilities during Destination UBC was to be a member of the student panel where members in the audience could ask open-ended questions and get answers from myself and 6 other students. I also organized and led an open "Get to know COSC at UBCO" room where students dropped in to take a look at several student projects they would be completing during their time at UBCO in computer science.
