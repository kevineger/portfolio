I am a fourth year Honours Computer Science <strong>student</strong> at the University of British Columbia Okanagan. I maintain a very <strong>active lifestyle</strong> and highly value personal fitness, health and wellbeing. I have devoted interests in music and the arts, which I feel reflects in my development work. The areas of development that intrigue me the most are <strong>full-stack development</strong>, <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>analytics</strong>. <br><br> I am a <strong>motivated</strong> and <strong>quick-learning</strong> programmer presently interested in internships, co-op work terms and part-time employment while completing my undergraduate studies. I am aiming to broaden my expertise by immersing myself in a <strong>fast-paced</strong> and <strong>team-oriented</strong> work environment.
