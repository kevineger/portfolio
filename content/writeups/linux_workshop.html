This January, I am teaching a 2 hour Intro to Linux workshop alongside friend and peer, <a href="http://nolankoriath.com/">Nolan Koriath</a>. Listed with many job requirements is Linux proficiency or CLI familiarity. After surveying a lot of upper level students within the university I decided it would be beneficial to offer this workshop and introduce students to a useful skill that can help their daily developer-lives.<br><br>This workshop is still in it's early planning stages. Pictures, teaching resources and updates coming soon.
