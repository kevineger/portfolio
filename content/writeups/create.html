Create is UBC's Okanagan campus' new student orientation program. It is a day-long series of events designed specially for the newest members of our close-knit campus community. We walked with the attendees as they took their first steps as new UBC students and gave them the tools to launch their paths to success.<br><br>I was an orientation leader for Create. My responsibilites spanned from preparing all the resources for the day, ice-breaking new students in to having fun and taking my group on a campus tour. I found this experience particularly fulfilling as I did my best to replicate for my group the great day I had on my first day of university.
