This January, I taught a 3 hour git workshop. Version control is a large part of development, in industry and school projects. Working in a team is near-impossible without it and attached to almost every job posting is "VCS" as a skill.<br><br>Students at UBCO don't see git (or any VCS) until third year during their software engineering course.<br><br>There were roughly 70 students in attendance for the workshop. It was a great afternoon and I really enjoyed passing on my knowledge to my peers.
