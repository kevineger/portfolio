This January, I am teaching a 3 hour git workshop. Version control is such a large part of any development. Working in a team is near-impossible without it and attached to almost every job posting is "VCS" as a skill.<br><br>Students at UBCO don't see git (or any VCS) until third year during their software engineering course. I am in the process of developing a fun, interactive and application-based workshop open to all UBCO students. There are currently ~60 estimated students in attendance.<br><br>Pictures, teaching resources and updates coming soon.
